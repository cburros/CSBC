Cherry Street Baptist Church files

I have decided to use Github to store a repository online for all files and projects created for Cherry Street Baptist Church. This allows documents to be uploaded and downloaded by users quickly and conviently. This repository can be made private, if so desired, and the link can be shared with anyone who needs access to upload or download from the repository. 

Uploading and Downloading are quite simple and the steps to perform both are listed below:
